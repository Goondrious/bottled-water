I don't think there are too many complicated or nuanced parts of plastic bottled water usage. There are non-unique "environment vs progress" and "the people vs industry" aspects, but I think the most interesting parts relate to personal behaviour.

It's an industry that started when access to clean drinking water wasn't as common and resuable bottles weren't as good or cheap. It has kept on, while being targeted by some hate and attempted bans, through marketing, public water fiascos that shake faith, convenience/habit.

### Habits or Preferences
- **Bottled water tastes better** - use flavoring, like lemon or vodka (jkz) or just wait and you'll get used to it.
- **Bottled water is easier** - carrying a bottle around isn't hard and actually reminds me that I need to drink it in order to survive.
- **Bottled water is colder** - You can put ice in your bottle or put it in the fridge :)

### Issues
- **Water = Human Right && Water Sovereignty** - being reckless can endanger the water reserves of specific communities

  - controversies around [Nestle in Calfornia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/us/nestle-water-california.html)
  - controversies with [Nestle in general](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/the-fight-over-water-how-nestle-dries-up-us-creeks-to-sell-water-in-plastic-bottles)
- **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle** - recycle is last for a reason!
- **Environmental Impact** - everything has a water & energy costs, but that _feels_ particularly silly for water.

  - a recent [study in Barcelona](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721039565)
   - a [summary](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210729122145.htm) and [industry response](https://bottledwater.org/nr/tap-water-life-cycle-assessment-misses-the-point-of-bottled-water/) (*Note:* I actually think this response sucks because it narrowly focuses on one aspect of the study and then rambles about some other bottled water stats. It feels like the result of someone assigned to refute any bit of anti-bottled water content.)
  - water usage is deeply contextual: it's not just total volume, it's also where, how, when (e.g. if a city wants to use the same well, but a company is already pumping vs an isolated industry usage)
   - [Nestle bottling in a desert](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/07/12/nestle-arrowhead-tapping-water/12589267/)
- **Bans on Sales** - they don't accomplish their goals of lowering plastic consumption and encouraging water consumption. People on the go will buy whatever instead. Drinking fountains, refill stations and a refillable habit are required.
   - a [university ban](https://www.npr.org/2015/10/14/448697099/university-of-vermonts-ban-on-bottled-water-backfires) that didn't work
   - [LAX airport ban](https://bottledwater.org/nr/los-angeles-international-airport-ban-on-the-sale-of-single-serving-size-pet-plastic-bottled-water-will-produce-more-not-less-waste/) that might not work
   - a [town-wide ban](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-water-idUSTRE5680TZ20090709)
- **Emergency Supplies** - bottled water is required in emergencies and current industrial infrastructure can help. This is why complete bans aren't great, but:
  - individuals can keep their own supply
  - reducing personal usage wouldn't completely remove industrial supply, so they'd still be able to help :)
- **Positive Industry Impacts** - organizations and companies have an incentive to be good stewards of water, though they may not act on it. There might also be positive byproducts of their PR efforts.
  - the [International Bottled Water Association](https://bottledwater.org) had some good coverage of [recyling day](https://bottledwater.org/nr/ibwa-encourages-consumers-to-recycle-right-on-america-recycles-day/)
- **Community efforts**
  - a lot of good hype on [Hydro Homies](https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroHomies/)
  - an interesting take by a [Danish company selling tap water](https://www.elopak.com/2021/03/05/danish-tap-water-in-cartons/)

### TODO
- other industry positives or byproduct-effect
- examples of cleanliness studies (include unclean from cities and recalls from companies)
- examples of companies coming through in emergencies
- breakdown of small vs large companies
- other examples of widespread behavior change
