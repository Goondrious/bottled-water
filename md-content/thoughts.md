Not a ban, not a boycott, but a widespread set of individual changes to behavior.

## Key Principles
- **Small Changes Make a Difference** - Our very existence puts stress on the world and many things might be excessive. We can move forward and enjoy life, while just limiting some things.
- **Community & Comradery** - Other-centered actions feel good and communal effort enriches any endeavour.
- **A Confidence Boost** - There are lots of complex issues everywhere which are hard to tackle. After the various impacts of COVID and so much diviseness (perceived or real), we could use a simple, non-judgemental and collective behaviour change. Bottled water usage could be that!
